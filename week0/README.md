## Notes
Binary System
- Humans use decimal system (base 10), computers use BINARY system (base 2)
- Each BIT = 0 or 1, each BYTE = 8 bits
- Computers can use binary system to represent:
  - numbers
  - characters (ASCII)
  - color (RGB, 3 bytes)
  - sound (frequency)
- Pictures = collection of pixels, each pixel = color
- Videos = collection of pictures (fps)

Algorithms 
- Algorithm = step by step process to solve a problem
  - Efficient = Halve problem each time (Log base 2 of n)
- Pseudocode = mix of english & programming language
- Functions = Reusable code that does a specific task
- Conditionals = Decisions based on conditions (ex. if/else statements)
