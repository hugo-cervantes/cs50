# Week 0 - Scratch Project

## Description
A simple Scratch program where the user controls a character (Sarah) by using arrow keys in an attempt to collect as many snacks as possible. Three snacks are present: an apple, cheesy puffs, and a donut (worth 1, 2, and 5 points respectively.) 

## How to Run
Open the .sb3 file at https://scratch.mit.edu/ and click the green flag. Alternatively, visit this link to access the game directly: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/1260538935 

## What I Learned
- Basic game logic
- Conditionals, loops, & functions
- Sequential programming

## Credits
The movement function was adapted from a separate Scratch project (Link: https://scratch.mit.edu/projects/326129433). All other game features are original.
