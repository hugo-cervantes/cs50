# Week 0 - Scratch

## Concepts Learned
- Binary System
- Algorithms
  - Input --> Algorithm --> Output
- AI
- C Programming Language

## Notes
Binary System
- Humans use decimal system (base 10), computers use BINARY system (base 2)
- Each BIT = 0 or 1, each BYTE = 8 bits
- Computers can use binary system to represent:
  - numbers
  - characters (ASCII)
  - color (RGB, 3 bytes)
  - sound (frequency)
- Pictures = collection of pixels, each pixel = color
- Videos = collection of pictures (fps)

Algorithms 
- **Algorithm** = step by step process to solve a problem
  - Efficient = Halve problem each time (Log base 2 of n)
- **Pseudocode** = mix of english & programming language
- **Function** = Reusable code that does a specific task
- **Conditional** = Decisions based on conditions (ex. if/else statements)

AI
- AI uses a neural network (like the brain) to give the most PROBABLE answer.
- Large data sets used to train AI.

C Programming Language
- Foundational programming language
- **Return value** is reusable, can be stored in variable
- **Side effect** = any lasting effects in function (not through return value)
